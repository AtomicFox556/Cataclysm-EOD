    "description": "A (relatively) lightweight heavy rotary machine gun.  Its six barrels are rotated by an electric motor, powered by UPS or vehicle.  If you could find enough ammo for it, it would become a devastating weapon.  This one has been modified to enable highly inaccurate hip-firing; it'd still require the shooter to have superhuman physical strength in order to be able to do so safely, however.",
